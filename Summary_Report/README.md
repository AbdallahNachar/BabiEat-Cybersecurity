# Summary Report

- **CIA Triad** defines security goals: confidentiality, integrity, availability.
- **Symmetric encryption** (AES, DES) protects data with a shared key.
- **Asymmetric encryption** (RSA) enables secure communication with public/private keys.
- **Digital signatures** provide integrity and authentication.
- **Network security basics** (firewalls, VPNs, HTTPS, port scanning) safeguard data in transit.

Together, these concepts form the foundation of cybersecurity practices.
