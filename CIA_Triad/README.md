## CIA Triad

The CIA Triad represents the three fundamental pillars of information security: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. These principles guide all cybersecurity decisions and implementations.

### Confidentiality
Ensures that sensitive information is accessible only to authorized individuals. This involves protecting data from unauthorized disclosure through encryption, access controls, and secure communication channels. Examples include password protection, file encryption, and user authentication systems.

### Integrity
Guarantees that data remains accurate, complete, and unaltered during storage and transmission. Integrity mechanisms detect unauthorized modifications and ensure data authenticity. Common implementations include digital signatures, checksums, hash functions, and version control systems.

### Availability
Ensures that information and systems remain accessible to authorized users when needed. This involves protecting against disruptions, maintaining system uptime, and implementing disaster recovery procedures. Key strategies include redundancy, backup systems, load balancing, and DDoS protection.

### Real-World Applications
The CIA Triad applies across all security scenarios. Banking systems require confidentiality for customer data, integrity for transaction records, and availability for 24/7 service access. Medical systems protect patient privacy (confidentiality), maintain accurate records (integrity), and ensure emergency access (availability).
