## Symmetric Encryption

Symmetric encryption uses a single shared key for both encrypting and decrypting data. This approach provides fast, efficient encryption suitable for large-scale data protection.

### How It Works
Both the sender and receiver possess identical secret keys. The sender uses the key to encrypt plaintext into ciphertext, while the receiver uses the same key to decrypt the ciphertext back to plaintext. The security relies entirely on keeping the shared key secret.

### Common Algorithms
- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)**: The gold standard for symmetric encryption, offering 128, 192, or 256-bit key lengths
- **DES/3DES**: Older standards, now considered less secure due to shorter key lengths
- **ChaCha20**: Modern stream cipher known for high performance and security

### Advantages and Limitations
**Advantages:**
- Extremely fast encryption and decryption
- Minimal computational overhead
- Ideal for encrypting large amounts of data
- Simple implementation

**Limitations:**
- Key distribution challenge: securely sharing keys between parties
- Key management complexity increases with number of users
- No built-in authentication mechanism
- Vulnerable if the shared key is compromised

### Use Cases
Symmetric encryption excels in scenarios where key sharing is manageable: database encryption, file system protection, VPN tunnels, and secure communication within closed systems. It's often combined with asymmetric encryption to solve the key distribution problem.
