## Network Security Basics

Network security encompasses the technologies, processes, and practices designed to protect network infrastructure, data in transit, and connected systems from cyber threats.

### Network Security Layers
Network security operates across multiple layers of the network stack. Physical security protects hardware infrastructure, while network layer security implements firewalls and intrusion detection. Application layer security focuses on securing specific services and protocols.

### Essential Components

**Firewalls**: Act as barriers between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks. They filter traffic based on predetermined rules, blocking potentially malicious connections while allowing legitimate communication.

**Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: Monitor network traffic for suspicious activities and known attack patterns. They provide alerts but don't actively block threats, serving as an early warning system.

**Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)**: Combine IDS capabilities with active threat blocking. They can automatically respond to detected threats by dropping malicious packets or blocking suspicious IP addresses.

**VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)**: Create secure, encrypted tunnels over public networks, enabling remote users to access internal resources safely. They combine authentication, encryption, and tunneling protocols.

### Common Threats and Mitigations
Networks face various threats including malware, DDoS attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, and unauthorized access attempts. Effective mitigation strategies include network segmentation, regular security updates, strong authentication mechanisms, and continuous monitoring.

### Network Monitoring and Incident Response
Continuous network monitoring helps identify anomalies and potential security breaches. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems aggregate logs from multiple sources, providing comprehensive visibility into network activities and enabling rapid incident response.

### Best Practices
Implement defense in depth with multiple security layers, regularly update and patch network devices, use strong authentication and access controls, segment networks to limit breach impact, and maintain comprehensive logging and monitoring systems.
